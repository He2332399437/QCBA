Motor Bearing Fault Diagnosis
With the breakthrough advancements of large language models (LLMs) in semantic understanding, logical reasoning, and cross-domain knowledge transfer, new research opportunities have emerged for motor bearing fault diagnosis in industrial settings. However, directly transferring LLMs to fault diagnosis scenarios still faces several challenges, including the few-shot learning problem, multi-fault coupling patterns, variations across operating conditions, and modality heterogeneity. These issues hinder the modelâ€™s capability in effective feature representation and generalization performance. To address these issues, this study proposes a multimodal fault identification framework that integrates the semantic modeling capabilities of LLMs with the physical modal feature representation. Specifically, the Qwen model is employed as the semantic branch to abstract underlying patterns within statistical features and extract high-dimensional semantic embeddings. Concurrently, the original time-domain, frequency-domain, and wavelet-domain information of vibration signals is preserved, with local physical features extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU), and Attention mechanisms. Through a multimodal fusion strategy, semantic information and physical features are collaboratively modeled, enhancing the model's capability to identify complex coupled faults and generalize to unseen operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.72% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, marking a 4% improvement over the state-of-the-art FD-LLM framework utilizing the Qwen model. In zero-shot multi-fault coupling tests, the method maintains an accuracy of 91.33%, showcasing exceptional 
cross-condition transferability and generalization to unseen faults. This approach bridges the gap between traditional fault diagnosis methods and the application of LLMs in collaborative modeling.
